{
    "Requirements Analysis & Scoping": {
        "Functional Requirements": "Functional requirements define the specific behaviors and functions of a system; they are the features that users directly interact with and experience. Think of them as the verbs of the system: what must it *do*? For example, for a ride-sharing service, functional requirements would include user registration, the ability to request a ride, fare calculation, and a rating system for drivers and riders. These requirements should be concrete, specific, and testable. They are typically derived from user stories or use cases and form the foundation of the system's core logic.",
        "Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)": "NFRs describe *how* a system should perform its functions, rather than what its functions are. They are the quality attributes that ensure the system is usable and reliable. Key NFRs include: \n- **Availability:** The percentage of time the system is operational (e.g., 99.99% uptime). \n- **Latency:** The time it takes to process a request (e.g., news feed should load in under 200ms). \n- **Scalability:** The system's ability to handle a growing amount of load, for instance, by adding more servers (horizontal scaling). \n- **Consistency:** Guarantees that all users see the same data at the same time. \n- **Durability:** Ensures that once data is saved, it is not lost. \nDefining NFRs is critical as they heavily influence architectural choices.",
        "Capacity Estimation": "This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate the resources the system will need. It's a foundational step to guide design choices. The process involves estimating key metrics like: \n- **Traffic:** How many daily active users (DAU)? How many requests per second (QPS) will the system handle? (e.g., 1 million users making 10 requests/day = 10M requests/day \u2248 115 QPS). It's also important to consider the read-to-write ratio. \n- **Storage:** How much data will be generated and stored over time? (e.g., 1 million users uploading one 2MB photo per day = 2TB of new data daily). \n- **Bandwidth:** How much data will be transferred in and out of the system? These estimates, even if rough, are essential for choosing the right database, caching strategy, and infrastructure.",
        "Scope": "Scoping involves defining the precise boundaries of the system you are being asked to design. It is one of the most critical first steps in a system design interview. The goal is to clarify with the interviewer exactly what features are expected to be part of the design ('in scope') and what features can be ignored ('out of scope'). For example, if asked to design a 'video streaming service,' you should ask clarifying questions like, 'Should the design include video uploading, comments, and a recommendation engine, or just focus on video playback?' Poor scoping can lead to designing a system that is too complex or that doesn't address the core problem the interviewer had in mind. Explicitly stating what is out of scope is just as important as defining what is in scope.",
        "High-Level API Definition": "Defining the API (Application Programming Interface) at a high level establishes the contract between the client (e.g., a mobile app) and the server. It specifies the rules for how they will communicate. This is a crucial step that clarifies the system's inputs and outputs. A good API definition includes: \n- **Endpoints:** The specific URLs that clients will interact with (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`). \n- **HTTP Methods:** The action to be performed for each endpoint (e.g., `GET` to retrieve data, `POST` to create data, `PUT` to update, `DELETE` to remove). \n- **Request/Response Formats:** The structure of the data sent to and received from the API, typically in JSON format. For example, a `POST /users` request might expect a JSON body with `username` and `password`, and it would return a JSON object with a `user_id`. Defining the API early helps to decouple the development of the client and server and solidifies the understanding of the system's boundaries.",
        "Data Model": "The data model is a conceptual representation of the objects or entities in the system, their attributes, and the relationships between them. It is a blueprint for how data will be stored and organized. Key steps include: \n- **Identifying Entities:** What are the core nouns of the system? For a social media app, entities would be `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`. \n- **Defining Attributes:** What information does each entity hold? A `User` entity would have attributes like `user_id`, `username`, and `email`. \n- **Establishing Relationships:** How do entities relate to each other? A `User` can have many `Posts` (one-to-many relationship). A `Post` can have many `Comments` (one-to-many). This initial data model is critical because it heavily influences the choice of database. A highly relational model might lead to a SQL database, while a model with less structured data might be better suited for a NoSQL database.",
        "Constraints": "Constraints are limitations or requirements that the system must operate within. They are non-negotiable and can have a significant impact on the design, forcing specific trade-offs. It is vital to ask about constraints early in the interview. Types of constraints include: \n- **Business Constraints:** These are often related to budget and time. For example, the system must be developed by a small team in under six months, or the infrastructure costs must be kept below a certain threshold. \n- **Technical Constraints:** These can be related to technology stacks or performance. For example, the company might mandate the use of a specific programming language or cloud provider. Other technical constraints could be performance-related, like the CAP theorem, which forces a trade-off between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems.",
        "Legal/Regulatory Constraints": "These involve laws and regulations that the system must comply with, such as GDPR (data privacy in Europe) or HIPAA (healthcare data in the US). These often dictate how data must be stored, handled, and audited.",
        "Use Cases (or User Stories)": "Use cases, often framed as user stories, are a way to capture functional requirements from the perspective of an end-user. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. The common format is: 'As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].' For example: 'As a *customer*, I want to *view my order history* so that I can *track my past purchases*.' This approach is powerful because it grounds the design in user-centric terms, helps to clarify the scope of a feature, and provides a clear basis for writing acceptance tests. By defining the key actors and their goals, you can ensure that the system you are designing will actually solve a real-world problem for its intended audience.",        "Assumptions": "In a system design interview, the problem statement is often intentionally vague and open-ended. A critical skill is to identify these ambiguities and make reasonable, explicit assumptions to narrow the scope of the problem. You should always state your assumptions to the interviewer. For example, if asked to design a photo-sharing service, you might say, 'I'm going to assume we are focusing on the core experience of uploading and viewing photos, and that features like commenting and direct messaging are out of scope for now.' Or, 'I'll assume we need to support 10 million users to start, and I'll base my capacity estimates on that number.' Stating your assumptions shows that you are thinking critically about the problem, helps to guide your design, and creates an opportunity for the interviewer to correct your course if your assumptions don't align with their expectations. It's a key part of demonstrating a structured and communicative approach to problem-solving."
    },
    "High-Level Architecture": {
        "Microservices vs. Monolith": "This represents a fundamental architectural choice. A **Monolith** is a traditional approach where the entire application is built as a single, unified unit. All code for the UI, business logic, and data access is in one codebase, and it's deployed as a single artifact. This is simpler to develop and deploy initially. In contrast, a **Microservices** architecture breaks the application into a collection of small, independent services. Each service is responsible for a specific business capability (e.g., a 'user service' or 'payment service'), has its own database, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. While more complex to manage due to the distributed nature, this approach offers greater flexibility, scalability, and resilience.",
        "Load Balancer": "A load balancer is a critical component that acts as a traffic cop for your servers. It sits in front of your backend services and distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers. This serves two main purposes: \n1. **High Availability:** If one server fails, the load balancer automatically reroutes traffic to the remaining healthy servers, preventing an outage. \n2. **Scalability:** As traffic increases, you can add more servers (scale horizontally), and the load balancer will start sending traffic to them, spreading the load. Common load balancing algorithms include Round Robin (distributing requests sequentially), Least Connections (sending traffic to the server with the fewest active connections), and IP Hash (ensuring a user is always sent to the same server).",
        "API Gateway": "An API Gateway is a management tool that sits between a client and a collection of backend services (typically microservices). It acts as a single entry point for all incoming requests. Instead of clients having to call dozens of different services directly, they make one call to the API Gateway. The gateway then routes the request to the appropriate downstream service(s). Key functions include: \n- **Request Routing:** Directing incoming requests to the correct microservice. \n- **Authentication & Authorization:** Verifying the identity of the user and ensuring they have permission to make the request. \n- **Rate Limiting:** Protecting services from being overwhelmed by too many requests. \n- **Protocol Translation:** Allowing services to use different communication protocols internally while presenting a unified REST API to clients. It simplifies the client and the backend services.",
        "Database (SQL vs. NoSQL)": "The choice of database is a critical architectural decision. **SQL (Relational) databases**, like PostgreSQL or MySQL, store data in structured tables with predefined schemas. They are excellent for applications that require complex queries, transactions, and strong consistency (ACID properties). They are a good fit for data that is highly relational, like users and their financial transactions. **NoSQL (Non-relational) databases** come in various types (Key-Value, Document, Column-family, Graph) and are designed for scale, flexibility, and speed. They do not require a fixed schema, making them ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data. For example, a Document database like MongoDB is great for product catalogs, while a Key-Value store like Redis is perfect for caching. The choice depends heavily on the specific data and access patterns of your application.",
        "Caching": "Caching is the technique of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary, high-speed storage layer (the cache) that is faster than the primary data source (like a database). The goal is to reduce latency and decrease the load on the backend. When data is requested, the system first checks the cache. If the data is there (a 'cache hit'), it's returned immediately. If not (a 'cache miss'), the system fetches it from the database, stores a copy in the cache for next time, and then returns it. Common caching strategies include: \n- **Cache-Aside:** The application code is responsible for checking the cache and loading data from the database if it's a miss. \n- **Read-Through:** The cache itself handles loading data from the database on a miss. \n- **Write-Through:** Data is written to the cache and the database simultaneously, ensuring consistency.",
        "Content Delivery Network (CDN)": "A CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers that cache and serve static content (like images, videos, JavaScript files, and CSS) from locations that are physically closer to the end-user. When a user in London requests an image, instead of fetching it from a server in California, the request is routed to a nearby CDN edge server in the UK. This significantly reduces latency and improves the user experience. CDNs also help to reduce the load on your origin servers, as they handle a large portion of the traffic. They are an essential component for any application with a global user base or a large amount of static media.",
        "Message Queue / Event Bus": "A message queue is an asynchronous communication component that enables services to communicate without being directly connected. One service, the **producer**, writes a message to the queue. Another service, the **consumer**, can then read that message from the queue at its own pace. This decouples the services; the producer doesn't need to know where the consumer is or if it's even running. This pattern is excellent for: \n- **Improving Reliability:** If a consumer service fails, messages remain in the queue and can be processed when the service recovers. \n- **Load Leveling:** It can smooth out spikes in traffic. If there's a sudden burst of requests, they can be added to the queue, and the consumer can process them steadily. \n- **Background Jobs:** For long-running tasks like video processing, a producer can add a job to the queue, and a worker can pick it up to process in the background.",
        "Service Discovery": "In a distributed system, particularly a microservices architecture, services need a way to find each other. Since servers can be added or removed dynamically, their IP addresses and ports are not static. Service discovery is the mechanism that allows services to find each other automatically. There are two main patterns: \n- **Client-Side Discovery:** The client service is responsible for looking up the location of another service from a central **Service Registry** (like Consul or Eureka) and then making a request directly. \n- **Server-Side Discovery:** The client makes a request to a router or load balancer. The router queries the Service Registry and forwards the request to an available service instance. This pattern simplifies the client but adds another hop.",
        "Stateless vs. Stateful Architecture": "This describes whether a service stores data from one request to the next. A **Stateless** service does not retain any client session data between requests. Each request is treated as an independent transaction and contains all the information necessary to be handled. This makes it very easy to scale horizontally, as any request can be sent to any server. A **Stateful** service, on the other hand, remembers client data from previous requests. A classic example is a user's shopping cart on an e-commerce site. While sometimes necessary, stateful services are more complex to scale and manage, as you need to ensure that a user's subsequent requests are routed to the same server where their state is stored, or you need a distributed way to manage the state."
    },
    "Component Deep-Dive": {
        "Database Sharding / Partitioning": "Sharding is the process of breaking up a large database horizontally into smaller, faster, more manageable pieces called shards. This is the primary method for scaling a database when it grows too large for a single server. Each shard is an independent database, and together they make up a single logical database. Key strategies include: \n- **Range-Based Sharding:** Data is partitioned based on a range of the shard key (e.g., User IDs 1-1,000,000 go to Shard A, 1,000,001-2,000,000 go to Shard B). It's simple to implement but can lead to hotspots if data is not evenly distributed (e.g., a new feature causes a surge in users with high IDs). \n- **Hash-Based Sharding:** Data is partitioned based on the hash of a shard key. For example, `shard_id = hash(user_id) % number_of_shards`. This ensures a more uniform data distribution but can make range queries difficult. Adding new shards is also complex as it typically requires rehashing and moving all data. \n- **Directory-Based Sharding:** A lookup service (a metadata server) keeps track of which shard holds which data. This offers the most flexibility but adds a layer of complexity and a potential single point of failure.",
        "Database Replication": "Replication is the process of creating and maintaining multiple copies of the same database. This is fundamental for achieving high availability and read scalability. If one database server fails, the system can failover to a replica. Common models include: \n- **Master-Slave Replication:** All write operations are sent to a single master node. The master then asynchronously or synchronously copies the changes to one or more slave nodes. Read operations can be distributed across the slaves, thus scaling read traffic. This is the most common replication pattern. \n- **Master-Master Replication:** Two or more nodes are designated as masters, and any master can accept write operations. Writes are then replicated to all other masters. This provides high availability for writes but is significantly more complex as it requires resolving write conflicts when the same data is modified on different masters simultaneously.",
        "Database Indexing": "A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. The most common analogy is the index at the back of a book; instead of scanning every page to find a topic, you can go to the index for a direct pointer. Without an index, the database would have to perform a 'full table scan,' reading every row to find the data it's looking for. The most common type of index is a **B-Tree**, which is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. While indexes dramatically speed up read queries, they slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index must also be updated.",
        "REST vs. GraphQL vs. gRPC": "These are three different approaches to designing and building APIs. \n- **REST (Representational State Transfer):** The most common architectural style for web APIs. It's built on standard HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) and the concept of resources (e.g., `/users/123`). It's stateless and easy to understand, but can lead to **over-fetching** (getting more data than needed) or **under-fetching** (needing to make multiple API calls to get all required data). \n- **GraphQL:** A query language for your API. It allows the client to specify exactly what data it needs in a single request, solving the over/under-fetching problem. The client sends a query that mirrors the shape of the desired JSON response. This gives clients more power and flexibility but can be more complex to implement on the server. \n- **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call):** A high-performance, open-source RPC framework. It uses **Protocol Buffers (Protobufs)** as its data format, which is a binary format that is much more compact and efficient than JSON. It operates over HTTP/2, enabling features like multiplexing and server push. gRPC is ideal for high-throughput, low-latency communication between internal microservices.",
        "WebSockets": "WebSockets provide a persistent, two-way (full-duplex) communication channel between a client and a server over a single TCP connection. Unlike the traditional HTTP request-response model where the client always initiates communication, WebSockets allow the server to push data to the client in real-time without the client having to poll for it. After an initial HTTP handshake to upgrade the connection, the TCP connection remains open. This is essential for applications requiring real-time data transfer, such as: \n- **Chat applications** \n- **Live notifications** \n- **Multiplayer online games** \n- **Real-time dashboards** (e.g., stock tickers).",
        "Consistent Hashing": "Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing scheme that operates independently of the number of servers or objects in a distributed hash table. Its main advantage is that when a server is added or removed, the number of keys that need to be remapped is minimized. In a standard hash table, adding or removing a server would cause nearly all keys to be remapped. Consistent hashing solves this by mapping both servers and keys to points on a circle (a hash ring). A key is stored on the server that appears first as you travel clockwise around the ring. When a server is removed, only the keys mapped to it are remapped to the next server on the ring. This makes it an essential technique for distributed caching systems (like Memcached or Redis clusters) and distributed databases (like Cassandra or DynamoDB).",
        "Bloom Filter": "A Bloom filter is a space-efficient, probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. It is probabilistic because it can return false positives but never false negatives. This means it can tell you that an element *might be* in the set, or that it *is definitely not* in the set. They are extremely space-efficient because they don't store the actual elements, just a bit array representing them. A common use case is to avoid expensive lookups for resources that don't exist. For example, before hitting a database to check if a custom username is available, you can first check a Bloom filter. If it says the name is 'definitely not' taken, you save a database query. If it says it's 'possibly' taken, then you perform the expensive database query to be certain.",
        "Geohashing": "Geohashing is a system that encodes a geographic location (latitude and longitude) into a short string of letters and numbers. It is a hierarchical data structure where the longer the hash string, the more precise the location. A key feature of geohashing is that it preserves proximity; two locations that are close to each other will have similar geohash prefixes. This allows for efficient proximity searches. For example, to implement a 'find nearby friends' feature, you can find the geohash for the user's current location and then query the database for other users whose geohashes share the same prefix. This is much more efficient than performing complex geospatial calculations on a large dataset.",
        "Circuit Breaker Pattern": "The Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used to build resilient microservice applications. It prevents an application from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail. Much like an electrical circuit breaker, it has three states: \n- **Closed:** When everything is normal, requests flow through to the downstream service, and the circuit breaker monitors for failures. \n- **Open:** If the number of failures in a certain time period exceeds a configured threshold, the circuit breaker 'trips' and moves to the open state. In this state, all calls to the service fail immediately without even attempting to contact the service. \n- **Half-Open:** After a timeout period, the circuit breaker allows a limited number of test requests to pass through. If these requests succeed, the breaker returns to the closed state. If they fail, it goes back to the open state. This pattern prevents cascading failures and allows a failing service time to recover.",
        "Idempotency": "An operation is idempotent if the result of making the same request multiple times is the same as making it once. This is a critical property for building reliable distributed systems, especially when dealing with network requests that can fail and be retried. For example, if a user clicks a 'Pay Now' button and the request times out, the client might automatically retry. If the payment operation is not idempotent, the user could be charged twice. To ensure idempotency, a common technique is to have the client generate a unique key (an 'idempotency key') for each transaction. The server then stores the result of the first request associated with that key. If a retry with the same key comes in, the server can safely return the saved result without reprocessing the transaction.",
        "Leader Election": "In a distributed system, you often need to coordinate tasks among a cluster of nodes. Leader election is the process of designating a single node from the cluster as the leader, which is given special responsibilities. For example, a leader might be responsible for managing writes to a database, coordinating transactions, or assigning tasks to other nodes (workers). This ensures that there is a single source of truth and prevents the chaos of multiple nodes trying to do the same thing at once. If the leader node fails (e.g., crashes or becomes unreachable), the remaining nodes in the cluster can hold a new election to choose a new leader. Algorithms like Paxos and Raft are commonly used to manage consensus and leader election in a fault-tolerant way."
    },
    "Scalability and Bottlenecks": {
        "Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling": "This defines the two fundamental ways to increase a system's capacity. **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up)** involves adding more power to an existing server—for example, upgrading its CPU, adding more RAM, or using faster storage. While simple to implement (as it doesn't change the application architecture), it has limits. There's a maximum amount of resources you can add to a single machine, and it can become very expensive. It also creates a single point of failure. **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out)** involves adding more servers to a pool of resources and distributing the load among them. This is the standard for modern, large-scale applications. It offers virtually limitless scalability and improves fault tolerance, as the failure of one server doesn't bring down the entire system. However, it requires designing applications to be stateless and introduces the complexity of managing a distributed system.",
        "CAP Theorem": "The CAP Theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem, is a fundamental principle for distributed data stores. It states that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide more than two of the following three guarantees: \n- **Consistency (C):** Every read request receives the most recent write or an error. All nodes in the system have the same view of the data at the same time. \n- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write. The system is always operational. \n- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes. \nIn a modern distributed system, network partitions are a given, so Partition Tolerance (P) is mandatory. Therefore, the trade-off is always between Consistency and Availability. A system can choose to be CP (consistent and partition-tolerant), where it might return an error or timeout if it cannot guarantee the data is up-to-date, or AP (available and partition-tolerant), where it will always return a response, even if the data is stale.",
        "Single Point of Failure (SPOF)": "A Single Point of Failure is any part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. Identifying and eliminating SPOFs is a primary goal of designing reliable and highly available systems. For example, if you have a single web server, that server is a SPOF. If it crashes, your application goes down. If you have a single database, that database is a SPOF. To eliminate SPOFs, you must introduce redundancy for every component. For the web server, this means having multiple servers behind a load balancer. For the database, this means using replication (e.g., a master-slave setup) with an automatic failover mechanism. The goal is to ensure that the failure of any single component does not cascade and cause a total system outage.",
        "Rate Limiting & Throttling": "Rate limiting is a defensive mechanism to control the amount of traffic that a client or service can send to an API or application. It restricts the number of requests a user can make within a specific time window (e.g., 100 requests per minute). This is essential for: \n- **Preventing Abuse:** It can stop malicious actors from overwhelming a system with a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. \n- **Ensuring Fair Usage:** It prevents a single, high-traffic user from degrading the service for all other users. \n- **Managing Costs:** In a cloud environment, it can prevent unexpected spikes in traffic from leading to huge bills. \nThrottling is a related concept where, instead of rejecting requests, the system slows them down, often by placing them in a queue to be processed later. Rate limiting is a critical component for any public-facing API to ensure its stability and availability.",
        "Backpressure": "Backpressure is a mechanism that allows a system to gracefully handle overload by resisting more requests than it can handle. In a data pipeline where one service is producing work and another is consuming it, the consumer service can signal to the producer that it is becoming overwhelmed. For example, if a message queue starts to fill up because the consumer can't keep up, the queue can apply backpressure by slowing down or blocking the producer from adding more messages until the consumer has had a chance to catch up. This is a crucial feedback mechanism that prevents a downstream service from being flooded with requests, which could cause it to crash or lead to cascading failures throughout the system. It's a way of propagating the 'slowness' upstream to the source, forcing the system to slow down to a sustainable pace.",
        "Database Read Replicas": "A read replica is a live, read-only copy of a primary (master) database. This is one of the most common and effective patterns for scaling database read performance. All write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are sent to the master database. The master then replicates these changes to one or more read replicas. The application can then be configured to direct all its read queries to the replicas. This has two major benefits: \n1. **Read Scalability:** You can significantly increase the number of read operations the system can handle by simply adding more read replicas and distributing the read traffic among them. \n2. **Reduced Load on Master:** By offloading all read queries, the master database is freed up to focus exclusively on handling writes, improving its performance and reducing contention. This pattern is particularly effective for applications with a high read-to-write ratio, such as a news feed or a blog.",
        "Eventual Consistency": "Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed systems that prioritizes high availability and scalability over immediate, strict consistency. It guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, all accesses to that item will *eventually* return the last updated value. However, for a period of time after a write, different nodes in the system might return different (stale) values. For example, when you upload a new profile picture, it might take a few seconds for all your friends to see the new picture; some might see the old one during that window. This trade-off is acceptable for many applications (like social media feeds or product recommendations) where having slightly stale data is not critical. It allows systems to handle writes with very low latency, as the write can be acknowledged before it has been replicated to all nodes.",
        "Hotspots (or Hot Partitions)": "In a distributed data store that has been sharded (partitioned), a hotspot occurs when a single shard or node receives a disproportionately high volume of traffic compared to the others. This single, overloaded shard becomes a bottleneck for the entire system, limiting its overall throughput, even if the other shards are mostly idle. Hotspots are often the result of a poor sharding key strategy. For example, if a database is sharded by `user_id`, and a single celebrity user suddenly becomes extremely active, their shard will become a hotspot. Another example is sharding by a timestamp, where all new data goes to the same shard, creating a write hotspot. Designing a sharding strategy that distributes load evenly is one of the most critical challenges in building a scalable distributed database.",
        "System Performance Metrics (Latency, Throughput, Error Rate)": "These are the three most fundamental metrics for measuring the performance and health of a system. \n- **Latency:** The time it takes to serve a single request. It's often measured in percentiles (e.g., p95, p99) to understand the experience of the worst-case users, not just the average. Low latency is critical for a good user experience. \n- **Throughput:** The number of requests a system can handle in a given time period, often measured in requests per second (QPS) or transactions per second (TPS). High throughput is a key indicator of a system's capacity. \n- **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that fail or return an error. This is a direct measure of system reliability. \nContinuously monitoring these three metrics is essential for identifying performance bottlenecks, understanding system capacity, and detecting problems before they impact a large number of users. A sudden spike in latency or error rate is often the first sign of a system failure."
